The ICY40 board is equally suited for absolute beginners and ambitious digital logic enthusiasts. It covers complexities ranging from
simple combinational pushbutton-to-LED circuits to full blown SoCs (system on chip) with e.g. the [EC16 soft processor core](https://github.com/Edgar-Conzen/EC16).

The board is deliberately designed as a self-contained teaching tool, with its ample buttons, switches, LEDs, a tricolor LED, COM-Port,
a seven-segment display and an OLED graphic display. And its sensitive components are additionally protected by a case since the target audience 
is not (only) the soldering iron wielding hardware wizzard in his ESD-proof workplace but everyone with a computer and a desktop.

There are two external electrical interfaces: 
- a USB port that provides power, the programming interface and a communication channel (COM-Port)
- an 8-bit [PMOD connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pmod_Interface) (Type 1A, extended GPIO) if optional hardware extensions are desired
