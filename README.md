The ICY40 board is equally suited for the absolute beginner and the ambitious digital logic enthusiast. It covers complexities in the range from
simple combinational pushbutton-to-LED circuits to a full blown SoC (system on chip) with for example the EC16 soft processor core.

The board is deliberately designed as a self-contained teaching tool, with its ample buttons, switches, LEDs, a tricolor LED,
a 7-segment and an OLED graphic display. And its sensitive components are additionally protected by a case since the target audience 
is not (only) the soldering iron wielding hardware wizzard in his ESD-proof workplace but everyone with a computer and a desktop.

There are only two external electrical interfaces: 
- a USB port that provides power, the programming interface and a communication channel (COM-Port)
- an 8-bit PMOD connector if hardware extensions are desired

The EC16 soft processor core is free and open source just as the assembler EC16ASM.PY and the simple monitor program EC16MON.
Assembler programs can be written with a text editor like Notepad++ and uploaded with a terminal program like Tera Term.
