<h2 align="center">ICY40 - Lattice ICE40UP5K FPGA learning board</h1>
The ICY40 board is equally suited for absolute beginners and ambitious digital logic enthusiasts.<br><br>
It covers complexities ranging from simple combinational pushbutton-to-LED examples to full blown

SoCs (system on chip) with e.g. the free [EC16 soft processor core](https://github.com/Edgar-Conzen/EC16)

The ICY40 is deliberately designed as a self-contained teaching tool, with its ample buttons, switches, LEDs, a tricolor LED, 
COM-Port, a seven-segment display, a 128x64px OLED graphic display and a 320x240px LCD with 256k colors.

Its sensitive components are protected by a case since the target audience is not (only) the soldering iron wielding hardware wizzard
in his ESD-proof workplace but everyone with a computer and a desktop.
<br><br>
There are two external electrical interfaces: 
- a USB-C port that provides power, the programming interface and a communication channel (COM-Port)
- an 8-bit [PMOD connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pmod_Interface) (Type 1A, extended GPIO) if optional hardware extensions are desired
