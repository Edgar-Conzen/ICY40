The ICY40 board is equally suited for absolute beginners and ambitious hardware developers. It covers complexities ranging from
simple combinational pushbutton-to-LED circuits to full SoCs (system on chip) with the EC16 soft processor core.

Consisting of extremely sensitive components and intended to be a  predominantly self-contained teaching tool with ample buttons, 
switches, LEDs, a tricolor LED, a 7-segment and an OLED graphic display, the ICY40 is completely housed and has only two external interfaces: 
- a USB port that provides power, design data and communication
- an 8-bit PMOD connector for hardware extensions

The EC16 soft processor core can be programmed using a text editor like Notepad++, the EC16ASM.PY Assembler, 
a terminal program like Tera Term and the EC16MON monitor program.
